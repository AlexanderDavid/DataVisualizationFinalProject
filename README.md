# Twitter Disinformation Story

G02

Alex Day, Megan Fowler, Xiaohong Zhang

A story of disinformation spread on Twitter. The actual website is at [https://alexanderdavid.github.io/DataVisualizationFinalProject/](https://alexanderdavid.github.io/DataVisualizationFinalProject/#1) (it doesn't work great on phones yet, sorry!).

The twitter layout is from a [Pen](https://codepen.io/itslit/pen/MGzGab) on codepen.io and the dataset is Twitter15 dataset from [Real-time Rumor Debunking on Twitter](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2806416.2806651). 

Each group member was responsible for a portion of the story, and this carried throughout the project.
- Alex explored the relationship between average retweet time for a first level share and the type of tweet that was being shared.
- Megan took a look at the types of tweets being shared by inidividual users.
- Xiaohong built a network graph to explore how the tweets spread throughout users, and how time played a factor.
